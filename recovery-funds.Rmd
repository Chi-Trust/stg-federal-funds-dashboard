Federal COVID-19 pandemic-response packages have provided unprecedented aid to state and local governments, including \$800 billion that can be used flexibly to promote an inclusive recovery. These resources create an unparalleled opportunity for advocates and local decision-makers to ensure federal funds reach communities that need them most, close equity gaps exacerbated by the pandemic, and address the root causes of inequities. To take advantage of this opportunity, local leaders need timely data and evidence to ensure funds are used effectively and equitably.

**This dashboard tracks a subset of the federal recovery funds flowing into the City of Chicago, Cook County, and the State of Illinois** that can be used for inclusive recovery efforts that align with key priorities of The Chicago Community Trust: community investment, community safety, household investment, housing, and workforce development, which are all vital to narrowing the Chicago region's racial and ethnic wealth gap. The dashboard primarily tracks appropriations, or how much funding the federal government has committed to provide local jurisdictions. For a few select programs where information is available, the dashboard also explores spending by zip code.

We will add more program allocation and spending information as new data become available. For more information, including the **glossary and frequently asked questions**, see [About the Dashboard]{#sec-about} below.

###### Chicago Recovery Plan

The City of Chicago has issued a general obligation bond to fund some of the initiatives in its [Recovery Plan](https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/obm/supp_info/2022Budget/ChicagoRecoveryPlan.pdf). Chicago is the only jurisdiction in this dashboard that is explicitly blending local and federal dollars in its Recovery Plan. While the rest of the dashboard only tracks federal funds, we show the bond funding here to provide the full picture of Chicago's Recovery Plan. *For specific program details, see Programs Description tab*
