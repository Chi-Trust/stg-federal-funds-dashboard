<h1>DRAFT Federal Funds Tracker</h1>

**This dashboard is a draft undergoing active development. It should not be shared or used for analysis. The most recent published version of the dashboard can be found [here](https://chi-trust.github.io/Recovery-Funds-Dashboard/index.html)**

</center>

The [Recovery Funds Dashboard](./recovery-funds.html) tracks a subset of the federal recovery funds flowing from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES), the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2021 (CRRSAA), and the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) into Chicago, Cook County, and the State of Illinois.

The [Infrastructure Funds Dashboard](./infrastructure-funds.html) tracks federal funding flowing from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) to all recipients in the Chicago area.

All funding amounts in the Recovery Funds Dashboard represent allocations made by the federal government to the governments of Chicago, Cook County, or Illinois. The Infrastructure Funds Dashboard includes a mix of allocations and awards: federal awards funding for all previous fiscal years (which is more precise in exact amount and use) and allocations for the current fiscal year (for which award details may not yet be known). Allocations of funds to the state of Illinois represent the total funding available to be spent throughout the state, and not only in the Chicago area. At the allocation stage, we don't have enough information on precise uses to narrow to funds that will be spent in the Chicago area. For IIJA programs, the award information published by federal agencies is detailed enough to enable us to restrict the awards to the state of Illinois shown in the dashboard to only those for infrastructure projects in the city of Chicago or in Cook County. For CARES, CRRSAA, and ARPA programs, this level of geographically specific awards data is not available, so all allocations to Illinois are included.

# About the Dashboard {#sec-about}

The inclusive recovery funds we track represent a subset of COVID-19 assistance provided by the federal government. The dashboard only reflects funds flowing directly from the federal government to the State of Illinois, Cook County, and the City of Chicago that can be used for inclusive recovery efforts that align with key priorities of The Chicago Community Trust: community investment, community safety, household investment, housing, and workforce development, which are all vital to narrowing the Chicago region's racial and ethnic wealth gap. It does not include funds provided by the federal government directly to public housing authorities, school districts, universities, or nongovernmental organizations, such as non-profits or private sector firms.
